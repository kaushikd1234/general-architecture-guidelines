Materialized views can be updated, but the process of updating them differs from updating traditional tables. In a materialized view, the data is typically derived from one or more base tables or sources, and the view itself is a snapshot of that data at a particular point in time. Therefore, to update a materialized view, you typically need to refresh or rebuild it based on changes in the underlying data sources.

There are generally two approaches to updating materialized views:

Complete Refresh:

With a complete refresh, the materialized view is completely rebuilt from scratch based on the data in the underlying tables or sources. This process involves truncating the existing data in the materialized view and then re-populating it with the latest data. While this ensures the materialized view is always up-to-date, it can be resource-intensive, especially for large datasets.

Incremental Refresh:

Incremental refresh involves updating the materialized view incrementally based on changes in the underlying data. Instead of rebuilding the entire materialized view, only the modified or new data is applied to the view. This approach is more efficient in terms of resource usage but requires additional mechanisms to track and apply changes to the materialized view.

The choice between complete refresh and incremental refresh depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, frequency of updates, and performance considerations.

It's important to note that the ability to update materialized views may vary depending on the database system or technology being used. Some databases provide built-in mechanisms for managing materialized views and automating the refresh process, while others may require manual intervention or custom solutions.

In summary, while materialized views can be updated, the process typically involves refreshing or rebuilding the view based on changes in the underlying data sources. Complete refresh and incremental refresh are two common approaches for updating materialized views, each with its own trade-offs in terms of resource usage and complexity.
